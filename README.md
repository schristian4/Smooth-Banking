## Reflection

  - Incepted as a side project to update a users balance
  - This app was built to provide a smooth mobile banking experience 
  - The challenge of this project was traversing state and lifecycle throughout various components. 
  
This was a 2 week long project built on my free time. The project goal was to use my existing knowledge and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.  

Originally the goal was just to update the balance variable with a simple deposit/withdrawl input field. I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate and `--template typescript`.

One of the main challenges I ran into was user login/signup.

At the end of the day, the technologies implemented in this project are React, typescript, and a significant amount of VanillaJS, JSX, and CSS. I chose to use the `create-react-app` boilerplate to minimize initial setup and invest more time in diving in to the code.
